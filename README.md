<h1>AI Blackjack</h1>
<p>Greetings! This project is supposed to be a custom neural network implementation being trained to play blackjack. Most of the settings for the model are found in main.py, and if you want to watch a model play, paste the weights into the "start" variable in test.py. Make sure the weights and biases match what the model was trained on!</p>
<p>This is very much a work in progress, so don't expect too much, expecially with regards to speed. The training algorithm is multithreaded though, so it at least has that going for it.</p>
